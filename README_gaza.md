# 🇵🇸 About Gaza

**This project is dedicated to the resilient people of Gaza.**

At the time of writing, they are enduring a **brutal genocide** and **forced starvation** under a relentless siege.

- **Food**, **water**, **medicine**, and **electricity** are deliberately cut off.  
- **Civilians are being targeted**, and even **hospitals and shelters** are not spared.  
- There is no safety — only suffering.

We write this with **heavy hearts**, praying for **justice**, **mercy**, and **freedom** for Gaza.

> _“And your Lord is never forgetful.”_ — **Surah Maryam, 64**
